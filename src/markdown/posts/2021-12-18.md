If your work or school account does not provide you access to Power BI (for the purposes of publishing to Web, specifically the Community Gallery), you can create your own. 

You can check your existing account by navigating to **[https://powerbi.microsoft.com](https://powerbi.microsoft.com)**, then clicking "Have an account? Sign in".

If you receive the following message:

*"Sorry, we can't sign you up as ...*

*Your IT department has turned off signup for Microsoft Power BI. Contact them to complete signup."*

...and have no sway over your IT department to give you access, you can sign up for a new account instead by clicking "No account? Create one!", and set up your new email and password.

You can then start your Azure free trial. Fill out your details, which will require providing a mobile number for identity verification.

With your account set up, you can now begin creating your own "organisation" or tenant, which would have Power BI enabled. Begin by going to Azure Active Directory.

Click "Manage tenants", and create your new tenant.

Then create a new user under that tenant domain e.g. yourname@yourtennt.onmicrosoft.com, and ensure that new user is added to the Administrators group of the tenant.

For that new user account, assign the roles Power BI Administrator and Power Platform admin, which you can do from **[https://portal.office.com](https://portal.office.com)**.

Then you can configure "Publish to Web" from the Admin portal at **[https://app.powerbi.com](https://app.powerbi.com)**. There are plenty of other resources for setup recommendations. For example, this post from **[Radacad](https://radacad.com/power-bi-administrator-tenant-settings-configuration-you-dont-dare-to-miss)**.

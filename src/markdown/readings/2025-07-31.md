This book succinctly outlines 33 strategies of war derived from global military history and organised into five warfare approaches, progressing from areas of greatest control, namely yourself, to your team, and finally towards the enemy.

## 1. Self-directed

Set as the first warfare approach because everything begins from within. You must clearly define your enemies are and force yourself into conflicts without losing your cool. The purpose of this is to cultivate an adaptable mindset that fights with everything you have and prevents you from falling into predictable strategic patterns (p.6-7, 10-13, 15-17, 21-24).

## 2. Team

Next is to establish the team around you. The author discusses weeding out internal team weaknesses, including self-interested political people, the illogical groupthink from shared leadership, and those who go against the team's morale (p.40-44). This can be accomplished by keeping a tight hold of your command whilst remaining visibly fair (p.29-32). As your team gets larger, you can segregate it into smaller teams with each given an overall goal and the freedom of means to achieve it, but without losing discipline (p.36-37).

## 3. Defensive

This warfare is about strategies to avoid being attacked, or if you are forced to engage, then to do so economically such that you expend yourself only up to where your blows on the enemy count without wearing yourself out (p.51-52). This is often achieved through deceptive or propaganda tactics to deter attacks, such as intimidating the enemy with your reputation for unpredictability and irrationality (p.62-65). This warfare is also a way to control the flow of battle, such as coaxing your enemy's unmanageable emotions so they attack first and limit their next move, or by willing to sacrifice territory to buy yourself time (p.58, 68-69).

## 4. Offensive

Define your ultimate goal and take subtle steps towards it so your enemy cannot read and subvert your intent (p.78). Be prudent and unemotional by widening your perspectives to include those of your enemy's (p.73, 78). You'll develop the ability to see the everyday hints of other people's subconscious intents, thereby gathering more information on your changing enemy (p.83-85). Use that information to strike their weak points, which will in turn builds your army's morale and momentum (p.88-89).

This constant search for strategies to exploit enemy weaknesses makes this fourth form of warfare about subtly diverting your enemy toward your desired direction without them realising, using strategies like baiting them into traps, forcing them on the defense, and fighting them on your terms (p.94-95). Other strategies include:

* Identifying your enemy's crutches based on the principle that every strength is its own weakness, and find ways to remove those crutches (p.98-99). 
* Using divide-and-conquer effectively by separating leaders from their people (p.103).
* Coaxing your enemy into revealing their flanks, then striking said flank (p.106-107).
* Enveloping your enemy without revealing your true form so that your attacks seem too formless or "vaporous" to retaliate against (p.111).
* Flexibly plan multiple potential branch paths for effective manoeuvre warfare (p.116).
* Negotiate with unrelenting pressure, convincing the enemy that it's in their interest and they have no choice but to engage (p.120).

Lastly, the author emphasises the importance of how you end a war, noting that, win or lose, you must avoid worsening its conclusion, as it shapes your position for future conflicts (p.128).


## 5. Unconventional

Unconventional warfare demands abandoning moral purity, adopting a cunning perspective to avoid defeat (p.132). Here are some of the strategies the author discusses:

* Every form of conventional warfare mentioned so far has involved deception, but unconventional warfare explicitly involves deceiving your enemy's perception with camouflage and decoys (p.135-136).
* Maintain a constant cycle of conventional and unconventional warfare, being fully aware that the unconventional inevitably becomes conventional (p.142-143).
* Using guerilla warfare to cause maximum disorder over time, leveraging your enemy's easy-to-anger disposition by being a non-central target that's difficult for them to find and engage (p.156-157). This strategy relies on psychological attrition through elusive, non-conventional engagement, but you must be cautious if your enemy employs a scorched-earth counterinsurgency policy.
* Build your alliances based on need rather than on loyalty or shared values, which also necessitates building a reputation for being a beneficial ally (p.161-162).
* Lastly, the book discusses using sporadic acts of terror to sow constant fear in an enemy, and countermeasures against it (p.189-194).

Unconventional warfare is inescapable, as you must always contend with both external and internal enemies. The author exemplifies the latter in work colleagues who seek to undermine you, as your war against them needs daily unconventional methodology such as only lightly opening your enemy's psychological wounds enough that they self-destruct whilst you keep your hands clean. This is what the author poetically describes as letting your enemies fall on their own swords, rather than yours (p.166-168).

Writing a summary of a book that is already an excellent summary in and of itself felt strange, but I wanted to try.

This book has no anecdotal stories, which makes sense as it serves as a handy portable guide, though there are brief side quotations from historic figures scattered throughout. I want to keep this book for that practicality, but I'll probably additionally buy the full version as I want to see where the author derived his strategies and lessons from.

I was able to connect several lessons to my own experiences.

For example, the "Negotiate while advancing" chapter reminded me of my first year in university. In one class students participated in a negotiation activity pitting them in teams against each other to achieve prescribed goals. The students unknowingly adopted one of two negotiator types cited by the author from Harold Nicolson: warrior or shopkeeper, with negotiations often failing when one side mistakenly adopted the shopkeeper stance. I only really learned where that lesson was trying to go in retrospect through this book, which is you must be willing to become a warrior even if you are a shopkeeper at heart, and also be willing to inflict bad publicity against your counterpart (p.121-122).

Another of the author's lessons was one I discovered at work, which is that when communicating with others, try to get them to arrive at the conclusion as an achievement experience with you leading them, rather than you just telling them the answer and leaving them with a sense of inferiority (p.176). My work involved a lot of troubleshooting so I had to guide new and occasionally less systematic employees in developing their ability to question their own underlying assumptions and thoroughly investigate towards problem resolutions. I found that the more engaged they were with that process, the more they internalised it.

The bookâ€™s core lesson is that war is judged almost entirely by its outcome (p.178), and it outlines historically effective strategies to achieve those results. Whether it is deceiving an enemy or even a trusted ally, war and life in general involves using people to advance ourselves and there is no need to feel guilty about this human necessity (p.160).

With the seriousness out of the way, I couldn't help but be amused at one analogy on how to be a formless enemy like the mosquito, which "...give you nothing but an irritating whir in the ear, from all sides and angles... and you realize that the only solution is to stop fighting and move as far away as possible" (p.158). I recently encountered one, and realised there are many solutions. One that worked for me was to expose only one part of my skin to lure the mosquito in, then I used a water spray to incapacitate its wings and watched it fall helplessly to the ground where it then met my boot. The irony wasn't lost on me that I used the author's lesson on using an enemy's strength against them.

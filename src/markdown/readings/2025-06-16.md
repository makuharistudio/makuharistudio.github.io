This book covers the author's strategies on finding your Life's Task and navigating the phases to achieve mastery for that task.

The blog post below is my effort to extract the practical elements from the book's principles for my own reminder and ease of personal application. Though it was not until some time into writing it that I found the "Concise" versions of the author's books render my effort essentially moot, but I continued to finish this post.

I realised this when I was buying my next book, "The Concise 33 Strategies of War", and compared it to its non-concise version. Essentially, the author's standard books are what you want to read because they include more anecdotes, whereas the Concise ones are what you need as a portable guide.

I highly recommend this book. So much so I feel like it should be mandatory highschool reading. Or at least its principles be taught earlier on in a person's life.



## Finding your life's task

"Life's Task": the innate force of purpose which uniquely drives you and it may feel lost because you succumbed to counterforces like social conformity. Push past those counterforces and find it (p.26-28).

5 strategies to combat counterforces:

1. **Do NOT let the voices of others infect you**: Find something you are primally attracted to that's not infected by anyone else's desires by looking for signs that point to your origin's core (p.31-32).

2. **Avoid fighting over limited resources**: The career world's politics and competition can wear you down. So start in a field that approximately your interests then:
   - a. look for attractive side paths and stay on them until you find a niche, or
   - b. master that first field, then combine it with others to make a unique one you own (p.35-36).

3. **Avoid choosing false paths**:  Accept you chose your current career for wrong reasons (money, fame, attention, etc.). Fight the counterforces and establish your own identity (p.37-38).

4. **Do not get stuck in the past**: Your loyalty should be to your Life's Task, rather than to a career or company. Adapt your Life's Task to your changing situation by letting go of past ways of doing things to avoid falling behind (p.40).

5. **Avoid losing your way**: Listen to your deep frustrations about your incorrect deviation from your Life's Task and let them guide you back onto the right path (p.42-43).

In summary, resist the temptation to be like others. Apply yourself to the small things you are good at to build a foundation whilst learning diligence, discipline, and focus. Extraordinary people are clearly loyal to their calling. Define your Life's Task to set yourself onto the path of its mastery (p.45-46).

There are 3 phases toward mastery
* **Apprenticeship**: Learning basic elements and rules of the field.
* **Creative-Active**: Through practice and immersion, you have a comprehensive understanding of the field and are now able to experiment and play.
* **Mastery**: Deep knowledge, experience, and focus lets you see the complete picture and giving you greater command over the real world (p.3).



## APPRENTICESHIP PHASE

Only focus on transforming your mind and character. Be grounded in objective reality by learning to work with others, be disciplined, and handle criticism. Choose workplaces and positions with the most learning of practical knowledge with challenges to toughen and improve you (p.55).

This phase has 3 modes of being and strategies to navigate them:

1. **Deep observation / passive mode**: Set aside your needs, desires, ego, and preconceptions. Observe the reality of your environment by submitting to it and show your desire to learn. Pay attention to unstated rules and communication flow (p.56-58).

2. **Skills acquisition / practice mode**: Train your hands-on knowledge by aiming for the "cycle of accelerated returns" whereby practice becomes easier and enthusiasm makes you go for longer.
  
   To reach this cycle:
   - Start mastering only one skill so you can also learn to concentrate.
   - Embrace the tedium of practice because it embeds the skill so you can do it subconsciously.
   - Once your skill is automatic, observe yourself practicing and correct your flaws (p.59-60).

3. **Experimentation / active mode**: Take on more responsibility, exposing yourself to peer or public criticism and take it constructively. When you feel there is nothing left to learn, the apprenticeship phase is over (p.63).

### 8 Strategies to complete the ideal apprenticeship

1. Value learning over money
   - Find a place with people and mentors who can inspire and teach you (p.67).

2. Keep expanding your horizons
   - Keep moving, otherwise the world closes in on you due to your self-confinement.
   - Mingle with many types of people, forcing yourself to look for new challenges (p.68-71).

3. Revert to a feeling of inferiority
   - Avoid having a sense of superiority and closed-mindedness about your existing knowledge.
   - Foster your child-like sense of wonder and curiosity by participating as deeply as possible until you've learned to be independent (p.73-74).

4. Trust the process
   - Do not give up. Take your time learning so you can internalise it.
   - The only real hinders to your progress are your feelings of boredom, panic, frustration, and insecurity (p.77).

5. Move towards resistance and pain
   - Fight off the tendency to shrirk away from difficult things.
   - Do more than the conventional practice others have done.
   - **"Resistance Practice"**:
      - Do not be kind to yourself during practice.
      - Be your own worst critic by recognising and prioritising your weaknesses, then invent exercises to address them.
      - Keep concentrating even if it means doubling the intensity.
      - Give yourself arbitrary deadlines and standards, and push yourself past your perceived limits (p.80-81).

6. Apprentice yourself in failure
   - There are 2 types of failure:
     - Never trying an idea out of fear or waiting for right time; timidity is self-destructive.
     - Having a bold and adventurous spirit; failings become learnings that outweigh any reputational hit.
   - Repeated failure toughens you and shows what needs to be done (p.84).

7. Combine the "how" and the "what"
   - Don't just focus on visual design. Grasp how something works by studying its technology, as there is beauty in functional essence (p.87).

8. Advance through trial and error
   - This is a satisfying, non-rigid, and patched-together path to improvement.
   - Learn many skills in the direction that circumstances lead, but only if they relate to your deepest interests.
   - In your 20s, wander around to expand your skill base and possibilities.
   - Avoid following one career path, as that gets you in a career dead-end by your 40s (p.87-90).



## Mentor Dynamic

Mentors have the experience to tailor their lessons to your circumstances, whereas books and such do not, making mentor's lessons more efficient and internalised (p.103).

A good mentor encourages your separation from them once you've learned all you need and remains a lifelong ally. You needn't feel any guilt when leaving as your objective was independence via learning from them (p.100 & 107).

### 4 strategies to deepen the dynamic with your mentor

1. Choose your mentor based on your needs, inclinations, Life's Task, and future envisionment of yourself
   - Look for one who would give you the support, confidence, direction, and space to discover things on your own.
   - Be conscious of their methods or styles that rub you the wrong way as they may be a sign to move on.
   - Move on once you learned everything you want and begin the search again (p.109-112).

2. Gaze deep into your mentor's mirror
   - Your mentor must give you sharp doses of reality, and as an apprentice you must build from the feedback (p.115-116).

3. Transfigure your mentor's ideas
   - Adapt your mentor's ideas to your own circumstances to address the sense of identity loss from being taught (p.119).

4. Create a back-and-forth dynamic
   - Both need to keep the dynamic animated so the apprentice can learn as much as they can.
   - Improves on your mentor's teachings and discusses these with them (p.121).

The author cites Leonardo da Vinci: "Poor is the apprentice who does not surpass his Master" (p.119).



## Social intelligence

Do not be naive. Be socially intelligent. This is characterised by accepting the futility of changing another person's fundamental traits and having tolerance to allow them to live as they are, and understand them enough to influence their behaviour (p.125, 130, 137).

### Reading an individual's nature

You can induce how another person sees the world:
- Pay less attention to their words.
- Pay attention to their vocal tone, the look in their eyes, body language, and emotional signals for anxiety, resentment, and falseness.
  - Observe their actions and decisions to derive motives.
  - Extreme behaviours may be a mask e.g. them being overly friendly because they are secretly aggressive, or they tell jokes to hide their mean-spiritedness.
- Refrain from judging people straight away, and let the passing months reveal more because people have a public persona for self-protection.
- Understand that people are in a state of flux and you are just up-to-date tabs on them, so do not fixate on one image of them (p.139-140).

### 7 realities of general human nature

These are 7 patterns of negative behaviour and strategies on how to find and address them.

1. Envy
   - Identifiers:
     - People who praise you too much or are overly friendly on first meeting.
     - People with unusual levels of insecurity.
   - Strategy: Can only be countered by preventing it from being triggered.
     - If you are strong in one area, demonstrate a weakness in another to humanise yourself.
     - If the envious person is an insecure type, display interest in their work by turning to them for advice.
     - Do not be boastful about success and instead ascribe it to good luck (p.141-142).

2. Conformism
   - Identifiers:
     - People feel compelled to display opinions or ideas matching the group's standards.
     - The group's overseers can be dangerous.
   - Strategy: Do not display your difference from the group too overtly.
     - Wear a mask for the workplace, and reserve your colourfulness for your friends.
     - "Be careful in what you say--it is not worth the bother of freely expressing your opinions".
     - If you do differ, do not give the group the material needed to attack you for some other reason (p.142).

3. Rigidity
   - Identifiers:
     - People following procedures without knowing why.
     - People get defensive when their methodologies are questioned, especially if logic disproves them.
     - Group members get irritable or panicky at hints of change.
   - Strategy: Accept the fact others are rigid.
     - Outwardly display deference to their need for order, because championing change creates hidden enemies.
     - Independently maintain your openness to change, let go of bad habits, and create new ideas (p.143).

4. Self-obsessiveness
   - Identifier:
     - People justify their actions with morality or a saintly aura, but appeals to their assumed charitability results in decline because they have nothing to gain.
   - Strategy:
     - Make conversations revolve around them and their interests, and offer something concrete in return for their efforts (p.143-144).

5. Laziness
   - Identifiers:
     - People steal your ideas.
     - People want to collaborate but contribute less, with unfair expectation of equal rewards.
   - Strategy: Be prudent and keep your ideas, or at least details to yourself.
     - Be wary of people who want to collaborate.
     - In some workplaces a superior takes full credit for your work with your name excluded, but don't let same-level colleagues get away with it (p.144).

6. Flightiness
   - Identifier:
     - People whose ideas or feelings on matters change based on their mood.
   - Strategy:
     - Never assume what someone says is a permanent statement.
     - Be detached to people's shifting emotions, and focus instead on their actions (p.144-145).

7. Passive aggression (p.145)
   - Identifiers:
     - Person fears direct confrontation.
     - Low-level behaviours include:
       - Procrastinating on a project
       - Showing up late
       - Making off-handed offensive comments
     - Full passive-aggressive attacks have an outwardly friendly exterior contrasting negative actions.
     - "Passive-aggressive warriors" are so overflowing with insecurities that they'd be happy to ruin your life.
   - Strategies:
     - For low-level passive aggressives, if they are harmless then ignore them, otherwise call them out.
     - For passive-aggressive warriors, learn to identify such people and avoid them like the plague, there'll be evidence of past skirmishes.
     - For full passive-aggressive attacks there are 2 options:
       - 1. Get out of their way, or
       - 2. Return the attack with something equally indirect to signal they'll pay a price to continue. Only do this if you can be emotionally unentangled.

### 4 strategies to acquire social intelligence

1. Speak through your work by being efficient and detail-orientated in what you do (p.152).
2. Craft the appropriate persona for the world and continuously adjust it ahead of problemsby not settling on a single image and avoid being completely figured out (p.155).
3. See yourself as others see you, and correct your social flaws, especially ones with a pattern of worsening social dynamics (p.159).
4. Suffer fools gladly by accepting you too have been one, such that you accept the foolishness in others or at least tolerate them, instead of trying to change them. If you lack the patience for this, then stay away from those situations (p.163-164).



## CREATIVE-ACTIVE PHASE

The author outlines 3 states of mind we grow through:

* **Original mind**: During childhood we thought preverbally in images and sensations with a receptiveness to new information.
* **Conventional mind**: During adulthood we stop wondering about things as they and become defensive about the world we take for granted with a not-so engaged nor creative mind.
* **Dimensional mind**: Masters blend the conventional mind's discipline with original mind's child-like creativity by creating rather than consuming (p.175-178). Awakening this mind involves 4 methods:

### Method 1: Choosing the Creative Task to maximise your skills and knowledge

Your creative task selection must be like your Life's Task selection, connecting something so deep within you that you are committed to solve it regardless of the years of failures it may involve. Your genuine excitement will reflect as greater details in your output (p.179-180).

2 important notes:
1. Your chosen task must be realistic, reasonable, and can be a little above this if you're ambitious. But your skills and knowledge must be suited to pull it off.
2. Throw away your need for comfort and security, because creative ventures are inherently uncertain. Be an explorer who leaves the shore (p.181).

### Method 2: 5 creative strategies to loosen the mind

The mind "tightens" over time from a preference for consistency and from the narrowing of viewpoints whilst being focused (p.181). Here are 5 strategies to counter this.

1. Cultivate negative capability a.k.a. the ability to endure uncertainty by suspending your ego, opinions, judgment, and confirmation bias, and entertain a broad range of ideas and the unfamiliar (p.182-183).

2. Allow for serendipity by opening up to other stimuli and other research fields, giving full attention to unexpected ideas and where they lead (p.184-185).

3. Alternate your mind through your explanations of observations by speculating against your inherent scepticism, being willing to confirm or disconfirm your theories, and making tangible objects of them e.g. prototypes (p.189-190).

4. Alter your perspective and subvert your conventional mind by looking at problems holistically and at different angles, paying attention to anomalies without letting paradigms explain them away, and looking for what is absent as clue for unmet needs (p.191-193).

5. Revert to primordial forms of intelligence by thinking with your senses which can take the form of visualisation, diagrams, models, scents, and rubber ball squeezing (p.197-198)?

###  Method 3: Creative breakthrough -- tension and insight

You will reach a breaking point where you lose your initial energy. Accept this as a natural part of the process, and an indicator to distance yourself temporarily, which may give you the chance to reinvigorate. One approach is by manufacturing deadlines (p.199-201).

Here are 6 emotional pitfalls to avoid during the creative-active phase and how to address them:
1. Complacency: Constantly remind yourself how little you know to uphold your value of wonder.
2. Conservatism: Make creativity your goal, not comfort.
3. Dependency: Develop high internal standards and independence to find yourself without the opinion of others.
4. Impatience: Build an enjoyment for rigorous practice to go past your limits and apply yourself with the same vigour across projects.
5. Grandiosity: Build an attitude that regards public attention as a distraction and focus on the work and process itself.
6. Inflexibility: Avoid emotional extremes by feeling optimism and doubt at the same time, and be able to bend to the moment (p.202-204).

###  Method 4: 9 strategies for creative-active phase
1. Develop an authentic voice by being patient and mastering the basics of your intended skill (p.209).
2. Be opportunistic and open minded to search for an empirical fact that does not fit the paradigm and is of great yield and let it lead you, rather than beginning with a problem to solve or goal to pursue with trivial implications (p.214).
3. Mechanical intelligence can be a source of creativity by testing and using your own design or experiencing the product as a whole (p.219).
4. Natural powers of the brain can be leveraged by having a loose start in the creative process, having a wide knowledge in other fields, constantly improve your ideas through an ongoing sense of dissatisfaction, and enjoying the overall creative process regardless of time (p.223-224).
5. Look inward to express your unique inner self that's not sparked by a trend, consciously going against dead conventions, and create space to plant your new thing in our cluttered culture (p.228-229).
6. Understand the big picture and purpose, and avoid perceiving problems based on your technical knowledge to broaden your investigation paths (p.231).
7. Let accidents and contingencies play a role in the creative process, like finding other ways to use things (p.235-236).
8. Take a holistic approach by looking at things from many angles and dimensions to help unravel the truth (p.242).
9. Move beyond a duality perception by examining contradictions and going to a level past those opposites (p.245).

To make a discovery or creative work first requires great discipline, self-control, and emotional stability to master your field (p.245-246).



## MASTERY PHASE

Mastery is "...a sensation of suddenly possessing heightened intellectual powers after years of immersion in their field", experienced as intuiting or feeling more with high-level intuition of the whole being the ultimate sign of mastery (p.256-258). It allows you to "...maintain a sense of destiny, and feel continuously connected to it" (p.261).

### Keys to mastery

1. Roots of mastery intuition

"Primitive" or "high-level" intuition is driven by memory, and keeping it in memory requires repetition, intensity of experience, and paying attention. In time-critical endeavours, a master's intuited decisions are more effective than attempts to analyse all information. However, we live in an age where technology does that remembering for us, making our brains flabby from the decreased use. To counter this, take up hobbies that are fun and strengthen your brain's memory capacity (p.263-265).

2. Return to reality

The ultimate reality is that all life is interrelated with every event being a consequence of another. As specialists connect their disciplines to those of others, it is in a way creating the connections that return us to reality. We can participate in this trend of creating connections by pursuing mastery (p.267-268).

"The brain of a Master is so richly interconnected that it comes to resemble the physical world, and becomes a vibrant ecosystem in which all forms of thinking associate and connect" (p.269).

### Strategies to attain mastery

Masters know that trying to fit into a conventional mould dampens their spirit because the reality they seek eludes them. So they forge their own route, one others will see as unconventional. This requires an X factor necessary for attaining mastery (p.269).

Here are 7 examples of this X factor.

1. Connect to your environment - Primal Powers

   Achieve this by observing it and consider everything in it as a potential sign, constructing a system that has a sense for changes before they happen. We are in an era where we mustn't be distracted by technology, remember that technology is the means not the ends lest your brain atrophies (p.273).

2. Play to your strengths - Supreme focus

   Figure out your mental and psychological strengths, and work with them to find a path to mastery that suits you and brings you joy and unburdened by conventions that go against your nature, for example, Einstein's strongest qualities were not his knowledge of mathematics and physics, but his patience and tenacity (p.279).

3. Transform yourself through practice - The fingertip feel

   When you practice a skill long enough, the skill becomes automatic, with the sensation that the mind and body are operating together as one in a way that resembles animal instincts and it is the nature of the brain to be trained through repetition (p.288-289).

4. Internalise the details - The life force

   Love immersing yourself in the details for its own sake, and detest having to skip them. People these days are too much in a hurry to create a splash that they skimp on the details, so their efforts doesn't connect deeply with the public. Your creations need a life of their own, not momentary attention (p.293).

5. Widen your vision - the global perspective

   In competitive environments, a wider and more global perspective prevails because it goes beyond the moment to control the overall dynamic via strategy, whilst most people are locked in the present. You can increase your outlook by constantly reminding yourself of the purpose and your long-term goals (p.297).

6. Submit to the other - the inside-out perspective

   We have a prejudice to observe things from the outside to preserve our objectivity, but that may lead to incorrect assumptions. We never truly understand what other people experience, unless we continually expose ourselves to them to try to think from their perspective and without imposing our own values on them (p.303).

7. Synthesize all forms of knowledge - The universal man/woman

   One type of mastery is the ability connect different subjects, which is regarded as a universalising process. The human brain desires to create connections and this is what gives it its own will (p.309).


Failing to pursue mastery or deny its existence leads to feelings of powerlessness, disappointment, and enslavement to a false version of yourself which was constructed from other people trying to make you conform to their ideas, including your own self-deception that such mastery is only for geniuses. Do not waste your uniqueness. Find the most fundamental and natural inclinations you have, and express them as you pursue mastery (p.309-310).



## Reflection

This book feels like a sign post for those of us in the 99% of humanity who give up on ourselves, and shows how people who started off at the same or worse baselines than us, were able to craft themselves into masters.

The principles in it are timeless, and really should be mandatory reading for high schoolers.

As a self development book, this one felt more goal orientated compared to the "12 Rules For Life" by Jordan Peterson which felt more for daily living. Though I prefer this book more for its ease of reading and its mission-based intent.

Like most when I was young, I was fed the preconceptions of having to get into university and then get a job, with no questioning of why we had to do things that way. I feel it is better and more honest to say upfront that life is not a fixed path you have to follow, that opportunities are all around you no matter the age, and you need to seize them. That point is what makes this book work tremendously well.

You only have one life, and all the circumstances leading up to your existence were highly improbable, so use it for the core of who you are.

In terms of the anecdotes, my favourites included:

* Leonardo da Vinci's study into single piece moulding of a bronze statue (p.24), which was reminiscent of Elon Musk's idea for Tesla's chassis to be made of a single piece based on a toy car.

* Cesar Rodriguez who trusted the process of training and pushing himself, going from a benched panicked pilot, to becoming nicknamed the "Last American Ace" fighter pilot (p.77)

* William Harvey's approach of thoroughly experimenting his hypothesis before trying to push it onto others
  - He wisely confided his discoveries to the King early on to gain his trust and support.
  - Behaved humbly and with self-deprecation
  - Played the role of court diplomat and avoided aligning with any faction nor got involved in intrigue (p.150).

The book has a number of other wisdoms, but I'll list only a few of my favourites below. You can read the book to discover more.

* Following the lead of others or a book's advice is self-defeating (p.55). A little ironic here.

* "In the future, the great division will be between ... those who can acquire skills and discipline their minds and those who are irrevocably distracted by all the media around them and can never focus enough to learn" (p.64).

* "The very desire to find shortcuts makes you eminently unsuited for any kind of mastery" (p.90).

* "The problem with all students, ...is that they inevitably stop somewhere. They hear an idea and hold on to it until it becomes dead; they want to flatter themselves that they know the truth. But true Zen never stops, never congeals into such truths. That is why everyone must constantly be pushed to the abyss, starting over and feeling their utter worthlessness as a student. Without suffering and doubts, the mind will come to rest on cliches and stay there, until the spirit dies as well...You must continually start over and challenge yourself" (p.115).

This book covers the author's strategies on finding your Life's Task and navigating the phases to achieve mastery for that task.

It was not until sometime into writing this post that I found the "Concise" versions of the author's books which render the summarising part of my effort essentially moot, but I continued to finish this post. I realised this when I was buying my next book, "The Concise 33 Strategies of War" and compared it to its non-concise version. Essentially, the author's standard books are what you want to read because they include more anecdotes, whereas the Concise ones are what you need as a portable guide.

I highly recommend this book. So much so I feel like it should be mandatory high school reading. Or at least its principles be taught earlier on in life.

The first step is to fight off social conformity and other influences to find your own **"Life's Task"**, and to do it efficiently by throwing aside the past, false paths, and exhaustive fights over limited resources (p.26-32, 35-40). Extraordinary people are clearly loyal to their calling (p.45-46).

The second step is to get into an **Apprenticeship** phase to learn the basic rules and skills needed to achieve your Life's Task, starting by setting aside your ego to genuinely learn, gaining hands-on experience, and open yourself to criticism so you can improve (p.56-63). The author also emphasises that this phase is accelerated with two things: 
1. Having a good **mentor** who encourages your separation from them once you've learned all you need and remains a lifelong ally (p.100), and
2. Being **socially intelligent** enough to let others live as they are without trying to change them (p.125, 130, 137), and effectively deal with people who have any negative behaviours threatening your pursuits including envy, conformism, rigidity, self-obsessiveness, laziness, emotional flip-flop, and passive aggressiveness (p.141-145).

Once you have a comprehensive understanding of the field, the third step is to experiment in a **Creative-Active** phase by going beyond the disengaged, conventional, and consumerist mindset of adulthood, and develop a child-like creative mindset (p.175-178). You get to this by choosing a **Creative Task** that maximises your skills, dropping your judgmentalism for a holistic perspective, developing strategies to persevere through lulls in enthusiasm, and allowing serendipity to be a part of your creative process (p.179-245).

The fourth step of **Mastery** is characterised by your having a high-level intuition of your field built on your deep immersion, knowledge, experience, emotional stability, and discipline which also lets you create connections with other disciplines and physically change the real world (p.261-269). It also involves developing one's own "X factor" that forges their path to mastery, which can take the form of primal sensing, leveraging your innate strengths, practicing until your skills are automatic, and investing time into the details (p.269-309).

Failing to pursue mastery or deny its existence leads to feelings of powerlessness, disappointment, and enslavement to a false version of yourself which is constructed from other people trying to make you conform to their ideas, including your own self-deception that such mastery is only for geniuses. Do not waste your uniqueness. Find the most fundamental and natural inclinations you have, and express them as you pursue mastery (p.309-310).

This book feels like a sign post for those of us in the 99% of humanity who give up on ourselves, and shows how people who started off at the same or worse baselines than us, were able to craft themselves into masters. The principles and multitude of strategies in it are timeless, and really should be mandatory reading.

As a self-development book, this one felt more goal-orientated compared to the "12 Rules for Life" by Jordan Peterson which felt more for daily living. Though I prefer this book more for its ease of reading and its mission-based intent.

Like most when I was young, I was fed the preconceptions of having to get into university and then get a job, with no questioning of why we had to do things that way. I feel it is more honest to say upfront that life is not a fixed path you have to follow, that opportunities are all around you no matter the age, and you need to seize them. That point is what makes this book work tremendously well.

You only have one life, and all the circumstances leading up to your existence were highly improbable, so use it for the core of who you are, not for what others want you to be.

In terms of anecdotes, my favourites included:

* Leonardo da Vinci's study into single piece moulding of a bronze statue which was reminiscent of Elon Musk's idea for Tesla's chassis to be made of a single piece based on a toy car (p.24).

* Cesar Rodriguez who trusted the process of training and pushing himself, going from a benched panicked pilot, to becoming nicknamed the "Last American Ace" fighter pilot (p.77).

* William Harvey's approach of thoroughly experimenting his hypothesis before trying to push it onto others:
  - He wisely confided his discoveries to the King early on to gain his trust and support.
  - Behaved humbly and with self-deprecation
  - Played the role of court diplomat and avoided aligning with any faction nor got involved in intrigue (p.150).

The book has a number of other wisdoms, but I'll list only 3 of my favourites below. You can read the book to discover more.

1. "In the future, the great division will be between ... those who can acquire skills and discipline their minds and those who are irrevocably distracted by all the media around them and can never focus enough to learn" (p.64).

2. "The very desire to find shortcuts makes you eminently unsuited for any kind of mastery" (p.90).

3. "The problem with all students, ...is that they inevitably stop somewhere. They hear an idea and hold on to it until it becomes dead; they want to flatter themselves that they know the truth. But true Zen never stops ... everyone must constantly be pushed to the abyss, starting over and feeling their utter worthlessness... Without suffering and doubts, the mind will come to rest on cliches and stay there, until the spirit dies as well...You must continually start over and challenge yourself" (p.115).

This book was name-dropped in the author's YouTube lectures and interviews, so I bought a copy to try it. It is the first non-technical book I read since university, so it was not an easy transition to go from my preferred reading of factual and "to-the-point" near-discussionless information, to wading through such philosophical and life-orientated lessons.

Admittedly, I nearly dropped the book early on where it discussed the difference between light and darkness, as I felt it lingered too much on that point. I powered through that and was rewarded with interesting anecdotes from the author's life and clinical practice. Being careful not to spoil, the most memorable example for me is when the author and his wife looked after a neighbour's neglected child.

A part of me wished I had the knowledge in this book at an earlier age in life, but I do wonder if youthful impatience would have prevented me from properly incorporating those lessons.

These rules (or variations of them) I had already been aware of and tried living by before finding this book:

* Rule 1: Have good posture.
* Rule 4: Don't compare yourself to others. 
* Rule 6: Fix yourself instead of blaming others.
* Rule 7: Choose the actions that will improve your tomorrow instead of indulging in today's pleasure.
* Rule 8: Avoid lying.
* Rule 9: You don't know everything so try genuinely listening to others.
* Rule 11: Let yourself and others test their limits and be challenged.
* Rule 12: Enjoy the few miraculous and wonderous moments that life gives you.

These were the lessons that were new for me:

* Rule 2: Build the attitude to want to help yourself get a better life, regardless of any self-contempt or self-criticisms you have.
* Rule 3: Surround yourself with people who genuinely strive for their own self-improvement, and expect for your relationships with them to not be easy. It is better than having a supposedly effortless relationship with someone who sees your self-improvement efforts as a fault.
* Rule 5: Discourage behaviours in the people close to you which may lead them to becoming a social disgrace or being mentally immature.
* Rule 10: Communicate your feelings to confront those feelings and what you intend. Even when your efforts to be precise don't solve the problem, at least you will remove the ambiguity which is far worse than the problem.

Basically, the book encourages you to improve your internal locus of control, by setting your mindset and life in a constructive direction. One recurring way it does this is by confronting people so corrupted by their own nihilism, that they denounce humanity whilst hiding behind a false guise of being anti-prejudice.

My favourite quote:

"Aim up. Pay attention. Fix what you can fix. Don't be arrogant in your knowledge. Strive for humility, because totalitarian pride manifests itself in intolerance, oppression, torture and death. Become aware of your own insufficiency--your cowardice, malevolence, resentment and hatred. Consider the murderousness of your own spirit before you dare accuse others, and before you attempt to repair the fabric of the world." (p.198)

The book has a number of other wisdoms, but I'll list only 3 of my other favourites below. The rest you can read the book to discover.

1. You need to reveal yourself to the world for the best possible version of you to be brought forth into the world (p.212).
2. Make your ambitions based on the building of your character and ability because those will always be with you regardless of status and power which can easily be lost (p.224).
3. Deliberately say the things and go to the places that put you into the new situations needed for you to be switched on and placed on the path to be more complete as an individual (p.212).

In summary, the book may be a difficult read for the philosophically uninitiated, but the lessons are good. Truthfully, I prefer to listen to the author's lectures and interviews. They have less content, but there's more conciseness, logical reasoning, and stronger engagement in video format.

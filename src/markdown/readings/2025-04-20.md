This book chronicles the biographee's life from a challenging childhood to the founding of multiple companies that revolutionised key technology industries.

This is the first biography I ever read, and it was difficult because I found the idea of biographies to be uncomfortably intrusive. However, my curiosity to understand how someone who has achieved so much in a single lifetime in multiple highly intellectual fields can possibly exist won me over.

Before reading this book, my initial knowledge on the biographee was very superficial as I had only seen a few interview clips on YouTube. After reading this book, I better appreciate how ridiculously rare he is as an individual, and can see why some conspiracy theorists and Internet meme creators may equate this rarity to him being an extraterrestrial. I am happy to have that superstitious veil lifted and to see the extreme effort and sacrifices needed to create a paragon of human endeavour.

The biographee has been through many misfortunes that may otherwise be enough to cause other people to give into darker life paths. So to remain on his path in building the at-scale foundations for a better future despite these tribulations is amazing and proof he's living a full life:

- Born into a country where daily fatal violence in public areas is the norm.
- Physically bullied to near death as a child.
- Impacted by a challenging relationship with a now estranged father since childhood.
- Divorced mother who worked multiple jobs to make ends meet.
- Unable to make friends until he started university.
- Passing away of his first-born infant son.
- His political enemies manipulating one of his other children, causing estrangement between them.
- Romantic breakup leading to severe depression and impacting work performance.
- An ongoing neck injury.
- A seemingly chaotic-good alignment that constantly desires being in intense situations.

The problem with reviewing biographies is the misplaced tendency to judge the biographee as a person, rather than the biography as a book.

The book is an engaging mix of dramatic, heartfelt, and humorous anecdotes. Whilst the author occasionally expresses misgivings like describing the biographee's ability to present his vision "as a mandate from heaven" (p.94), the overall narrative feels balanced because of that tension. The author remains committed to presenting an honest account, allowing readers to interpret the contradictions for themselves.

I've decided to encapsulate some of the business-related lessons from the book in areas like leadership, team dynamics, communication, etc. for ease of personal reference. This book has a multitude of other lessons in morality, integrity, relationships, politics, and more, but those and the anecdotes won't be covered here. Please refer to the book for that information.



## PERSONAL MINDSET

### Define who you are
Find the thing you want to do which will have the most impact because pursuing that may be the best way to spend your life, rather than on something else you may enjoy doing or are good at but has low impact (p.56). Once you've identified that, then identify if you are okay working for other people to pursue it, or if you prefer having people work for you, so you can commit to that preference earlier on in life (p.48).

### Learn by risk-taking
Do not base your decisions out of fear of something, instead use the risk as your fuel to push yourself forward (p.25, 252). Even when your risk-taking fails, do your best to make every bad situation salvageable (p.116). When your risk-taking succeeds, don't waste the wealth earned from it into short-term pleasures that achieve nothing, invest it back into the game of life and play again (p.67).

### Use objective and iterative problem-solving
Know when to step back from your emotions and to reframe a problem (p.99 & 247). Take an iterative approach and learn by failing with the attitude of quickly getting back up to identify each successive problem so you can fix them (p.114). Have the humility to accept being wrong, just don't be confidently wrong (p.286).

###	"Polytopia life lessons"
Polytopia is a video game that the biographee recommended to his brother on learning how to be a CEO, and these are key lessons from the game (p.426-427)
1.	Empathy is a liability in business.
2.	"Play life like a game".
3.	Losing is inevitable and will happen many times. Get used to it so you become fearless and take more risks.
4.	Be proactive and take charge of setting the strategy.
5.	Optimise every turn you have in life, and let nothing slide.
6.	Put everything back into the game to grow.
7.	Pick your battles carefully by using front minimisation tactics.
8.	Unplug at times by removing distractions.



## STRATEGY AND VISION

### Define a broad business mission
When your company mission is important enough, optimism and pessimism are irrelevant. All that matters is taking the steps forward to achieve the mission, then work backward to figure out how to make it work financially (p.177 & 93). Make the mission broad like an innovation company, which is also advantageous in that any future acquisitions or mergers will be less challenged for being in line with the core innovation mission (p.254-257).

### Find entrepreneurial opportunities
Do not let incumbent industry mindset inhibit you from seeing opportunities in that industry (p.48). For example, figure out the reasons why that industry isn't doing well, and simplify the process for the customer by taking on the legwork to fix those problems (p.252). Be open to other business models to side-fund your main model, like selling a component your supply chain makes to another business, tying different endeavours together into a new one, or using data collected for a new purpose (p.193, 243-244).

### Build a company attitude of anti-complacency
A "maniacal sense of urgency" is needed as an operating principle for companies to avoid being flabby and slow because complacency can be a scourge to business (p.286, 349, 508). If your company is already too conservative and long-lived, quickly accept that you need to change, and adopt entrepreneurial efforts (p.222).

### Be a product company, not a sales nor a platform company
A platform company is merely an unbranded vendor for incumbent industry leaders (p.63-65), and a sales company neglects the philosophy that you should make a great product then let the sales follow up by themselves after that (p.253). So, it is important to be product-first. For high-cost industries, you can create a high-price and quality iteration before designing a mass-market model (p.127). You can also more easily gain public awareness by displaying prototypes to the public (p.121, 194).



## LEADERSHIP

### Lead by example, not by empathy
An effective leader is like a general on a battlefield, they need hands-on experience on the factory floor and be willing to do what they asked of the workers, otherwise they shouldn't ask the workers to do those things in the first place (p.285-286, 480). They have the openness to take in the risk information and data from their team, the flexibility to have their mind changed by the evidence, the decisiveness to make quick assessments and shift responsibility from the team to themselves, and the resolve to take ownership for their mistakes even if it needs to be done publicly (p.210, 282, 407). It is not the leader's job to make people love them, as that just leads to counterproductivity (p.64).

### Communicate with workers rather than executives
Spend your time on the shop floor listening to the suggestions of floor workers to find problems to solve and get information regarding limits your company can go beyond, one way to implement this is by performing skip-level meetings so workers can bypass direct supervisors and have their ideas heard (p.157, 286, 328). Be willing to treat people politely and respectfully, as not treating them well may make them disinclined to tell you where the problems are (p.166).

### Draw clear lines for segregation of duties
Be clear to employees that duties precede relationships. For example, if you are trying to drive down costs, ensure your financial analysts understand they are not to befriend the engineers who set the costs, because the analysts need to serve as objective judges of the engineers (p.363). Enforce internal transparency and integrity by proactively asking and investigating staff so that you can find conflicts of interest that are being hidden because there is no incentive for those conflicts which threaten your operations to out themselves (p.571).

### Proactively fight against analysis paralysis
Leaders need to step in when analysis paralysis is happening, to make decisions that will move efforts forward fast by trying, failing, then fixing, instead of spending months on analysis prior to taking action (p.388).



## TEAM DYNAMICS

### Hire team members based on attitude over skills and experience
"When hiring, look for people with the right attitude. Skills can be taught. Attitude changes require a brain transplant" (p.286). Prioritise candidates who have an attitude to work maniacally hard, but be wary of anyone whose confidence is greater than their competence (p.350, 512). If you want to have a hardcore, fanatic work culture, you need to have a staffing method that cuts to the bone (p.522).

### Encourage team members to prioritise their feedback loops over comradery
It is inevitable that employees will need a good feedback loop and have the initiative to seek criticism from others to improve (p.365). Comradery can be dangerous because it makes it hard for people to challenge each other's work, creating a counterproductive tendency to avoid throwing colleagues under the bus, but that tendency needs to be avoided for improvement to begin (p.285).

### Prepare the team to support a leader who is steering off the rails
No one is perfect, and even a leader can make severely bad decisions out of impulsive emotion. To handle this, have a team member inform them as such and have other team members raise it with them to show consensus. Then ensure the team quietly knows to avoid carrying out reactionary orders from that leader until the storm of emotion passes and when that leader is able to properly process the inputs (p.539).



## PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

### Innovate by setting metrics as your goal post
Innovative business ideas come from translating the inefficiencies of existing technologies as clear metrics, like the time take to manually type information into a computer or the cost per pound to get a payload into orbit, then working hard to improve that metric's value by advancing its underlying technology (p.93, 355, 399). The metric's value can be displayed on a large monitor, so the team can treat it like a game to try to improve it, making it also a measure for product engineering performance (p.596).

### Initial product brainstorming
First think of the materials used to build your product including the reasonings for those materials and the product's structure, then have the team members create a detailed chart of any functionality they want and the cost of manufacturing each at scale (p.316, 486).

### Co-locate engineers with designers
Have designers and engineers work together in the same room so they can have a "throw-it-over-the-fence" mentality such they think like the other, because true industrial design connects the beauty of a product to its engineering (p.79, 137, 200). Separating product design from engineering is a recipe for dysfunction, so ensure you have set things up such that designers feel immediate pain if something they devised is hard to engineer. For this reason, engineers should lead the design process rather than product managers (p.79).



## MANUFACTURING

### Empower assembly line teams using factory layout
When designing a factory, make the layout so that an assembly line person can collar a designer or engineer and hold them accountable to bad designs (p.109). This can be achieved by placing the cubicles for the engineers beside the assembly lines, so they can see when something goes wrong and hear complaints if their design causes a slowdown (p.219). Make it a collective responsibility by corralling the engineers to frequently walk up and down the assembly lines with you to assess the production line's efficiency, so if they find an aspect of product design is expensive to produce, it'll require changing the design (p.219, 390).

### Inhouse your supply chain and minimise dependencies
Although outsourcing may be cheaper, a poor international supply chain can be a logistical nightmare and can cause cash-flow problems (p.160). Key components should be made inhouse to control quality, costs, and supply chain, whilst aiming for vertical integration (p.132). In-housing can be further improved by pursuing good manufacturing process inspirations, like the cold casting mould method used for toy cars which removes the need to piece together hundreds of parts (p.338). You can also cleverly get 24 hours of production with 16 hours of human labour using machines and careful prediction of when human intervention would be necessary, which helps get around labour laws whilst maximising production time (p.158-159).

### Challenge costs
Challenge your suppliers on costs they charge on components, especially if there are equivalent cheaper components in other industries, or consider making it in-house at a fraction of the price (p.112). 

### Pursue efficiency via the "Idiot Index" and "The algorithm"
The **idiot index** identifies the economically problematic components in the production process, and **the algorithm** is a methodology to improve the production process itself.

The **idiot index** is "...the ratio of the total cost of a component to the cost of its raw materials. Something with a high idiot index--say a component that cost $1,000 when the aluminium that composed it only cost $100--was likely to have a design that was too complex or a manufacturing process that was too inefficient...If the ratio is high, you're an idiot" for not addressing it (p.363).

**"The algorithm"** is a 5-point checklist (p.284-285):
1. "Question every requirement. Each should come with the name of the person who made it. You should never accept that a requirement came from a department... Then you should question it, no matter how smart that person is...Then make the requirements less dumb".
2. "Delete any part or process you can. You may have to add them back later. In fact, if you do not end up adding back at least 10% of them, then you didn't delete enough".
3. "Simplify and optimize. This should come after step two. A common mistake is to simplify and optimize a part or a process that should not exist".
4. "Accelerate cycle time. Every process can be [ sped ] up. But only do this after you have followed the first three steps", it is a mistake to automate first because some time accelerating processes may need to be removed altogether.
5. Automate. This comes last in designing the production process. Wait until all requirements have been questioned, and all unnecessary parts and processes deleted.



## NEGOTIATION

### Stay calm against disruptive opening offers
During a business negotiation, if your counterpart is exaggerating numbers and making an offer that would be considered illogical, be patient and consider the possibility that it is just their opening move, before walking away from the table entirely. Some people just like to play games (p.77).

### Convince with tangible actions, not with words alone
If you have a potential partner hesitant to join forces with yours, one strategy is to physically demonstrate at a very large scale, that your side is willing to plough ahead with your endeavour even without the potential partner, like the building of a for-purpose factory (p.221).

### Do due diligence for acquisitions
When making a deal to buy out a company, make it contingent on full due diligence to minimise the trouble it would otherwise cause later (p.463).

### Pursue outcomes and merit-based work
Cost-plus contracts are where you are paid for your costs plus guaranteed profit, which is ineffective as it is an incentive to never finish work. If such a system is in place, challenge it with outcomes-based fixed pricing where companies should be risking their own capital (p.123). 



## 3 OTHER USEFUL NOTES

1. First principles thinking involves "...drilling down to the basic physics of the situation and building up from there" (p.99). Approach your problems using this mindset.

2. One way to show you are listening in meetings, is to parrot back what others are saying as confirmation you've understood what they have said (p.368). This is similar to an approach mentioned in Jordan Peterson's "12 Rules of Life", where you need to accurately summarise a person's ideas as you understand them, before conveying your own points.

3. Here is a list of authors and books mentioned as having been read by the biographee:

```

* Douglas Adams
  │── "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" (1979, sci-fi)
* Isaac Asimov

* The Onion
  │── "Our Dumb Century" (1999, satire)

Magazines:
* Amazing Stories magazine (1926-1939, sci-fi)
```



This book is an excellent testament to how belief in humanity, curiosity, intelligence, sheer force of will, luck, and karma can overcome near-impossible odds and make an at-scale tangible difference. It also shows the depth of sacrifice and toll it takes to pursue such a path.

The biographee envisions humanity being more technologically advanced than now to achieve species-level self-determination in the universe. His success in making tangible steps toward this explains why his efforts are often widely acclaimed.

After reading it, this book may provoke your dormant nihilism, an existential crisis of self-comparison, or inspiration for positive change--so choose wisely. Personally, I'll opt for the hopeful outlook.

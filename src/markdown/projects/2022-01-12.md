This is my first use of SQL Server Integration Services to merge and transform three different fictional data sources into a single one.

The data sources used are:
* Microsoft's Wide World Importers database
* Microsoft's Contoso data warehouse
* Tableau's Sample Superstore dataset

For an overview of how this dataset was created, please refer to my blog post: [https://makuharistudio.github.io/#/blog/international-marketplace-dataset-created-with-integration-services](https://makuharistudio.github.io/#/blog/international-marketplace-dataset-created-with-integration-services).

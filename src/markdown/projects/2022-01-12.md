This is my first use of SQL Server Integration Services to merge and transform 3 different fictional data sources into a single one.

The data sources used are:
* Microsoft's Wide World Importers database
* Microsoft's "Contoso" data warehouse
* Tableau's Sample APAC Superstore dataset

For an overview of how this dataset was created, please refer to my blog post: [https://makuharistudio.github.io/blog/international-marketplace-dataset-created-with-integration-services](https://makuharistudio.github.io/blog/international-marketplace-dataset-created-with-integration-services).

For the SQL scripts I made for this SSIS project and other details, please refer to my GitHub: [https://github.com/makuharistudio/data-visualisation-datasets/tree/main/International%20Marketplace%20sales](https://github.com/makuharistudio/data-visualisation-datasets/tree/main/International%20Marketplace%20sales).

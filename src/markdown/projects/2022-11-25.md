You can view (but not download) my report from the official Power BI Data Stories Gallery:

This Power BI report demonstrates custom AppSource Deneb maps using embedded geometry JSON data.

This is by no means an efficient way to create geographic maps with AppSource Deneb, but it does prove that it can be done, if for whatever reason you are not allowed to use the standalone Deneb version.
 
As this is a personal portfolio project, the pbix file won't be provided.
 
Alternatively, if you would like a tutorial outline to learn how to get this geographic map data or how to embed it into AppSource Deneb, please see my blog post: **[https://makuharistudio.github.io/#/blog/how-to-use-geographic-maps-in-power-bi-with-appsource-deneb](https://makuharistudio.github.io/#/blog/how-to-use-geographic-maps-in-power-bi-with-appsource-deneb)**.

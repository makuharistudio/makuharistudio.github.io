You can view (but not download) my report from the official Power BI Data Stories Gallery:

This Power BI report is my first attempt at incorporating the following into a fictional profit report:

1. A Python predictive model based on a tutorial by Absent Data: [https://www.absentdata.com/power-bi/forecasting-with-python-and-power-bi](https://www.absentdata.com/power-bi/forecasting-with-python-and-power-bi).

2. Custom visuals using Deneb (a custom visual by Daniel Marsh-Patrick **[https://deneb-viz.github.io](https://deneb-viz.github.io)**) and style is based on Tableau visual designs by Pradeep Kumar G **[https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/pradeepkumar.g](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/pradeepkumar.g)**.

As this is a personal portfolio project, the pbix file won't be provided.

Alternatively, if you would like a tutorial outline to learn one way to create forecast data in Python and bring it into Power BI, please see my blog post: **[https://makuharistudio.github.io/#/blog/add-forecasts-from-python-using-visual-studio-code-to-power-bi](https://makuharistudio.github.io/#/blog/add-forecasts-from-python-using-visual-studio-code-to-power-bi)**

Some of the underlying Power Query code is available here: **[https://github.com/makuharistudio/data-visualisation-datasets/blob/main/International%20Marketplace%20sales/Power%20Query%20and%20Deneb%20code.md](https://github.com/makuharistudio/data-visualisation-datasets/blob/main/International%20Marketplace%20sales/Power%20Query%20and%20Deneb%20code.md)**.

This Power BI report is my first published publically, showing median rental prices of key towns in Singapore across different major curriencies.

As this is a personal portfolio project, the pbix file won't be provided.

Some of the underlying Power Query code is available here: **[https://github.com/makuharistudio/data-visualisation-datasets/tree/main/Singapore%20rental%20prices](https://github.com/makuharistudio/data-visualisation-datasets/tree/main/Singapore%20rental%20prices)**.

This Power BI report is my first published publicly, it shows median rental prices of key towns in Singapore across different major currencies.

As this is a personal portfolio project, the PBIX file won't be provided.

Some of the underlying Power Query code is available here: **[https://github.com/makuharistudio/data-visualisation-datasets/tree/main/Singapore%20rental%20prices](https://github.com/makuharistudio/data-visualisation-datasets/tree/main/Singapore%20rental%20prices)**.

This Excel report is a redux of my "Follow the sun customer support" Power BI report, the latter you can find here:

**[https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Data-Stories-Gallery/Follow-the-sun-customer-service-support/m-p/2168279](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Data-Stories-Gallery/Follow-the-sun-customer-service-support/m-p/2168279)**

[![Animated preview of Power BI version](../assets/portfolio/img-2022-04-power-bi-international-marketplace-python-deneb.gif)](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Data-Stories-Gallery/Follow-the-sun-customer-service-support/m-p/2168279)

Most of the code used is similar to my Power BI report, except most of the DAX measures now include USERELATIONSHIP due to a data model improvement. You can find some of that code in my Github here:

**[https://github.com/makuharistudio/data-visualisation-datasets/tree/main/Support%20ticket%20updates#excel-report-model](https://github.com/makuharistudio/data-visualisation-datasets/tree/main/Support%20ticket%20updates#excel-report-model)**

The Excel report is also embedded below using the OneDrive free version.

Due to OneDrive's restrictions with External Data Connections and Camera Tools, the report cannot dynamically display support agent images nor refresh its data connection.

It is recommended you download the file and open it from a desktop version of Excel. It connects to my GitHub repository data, so please click "Enable content" to access that External Data Connection.

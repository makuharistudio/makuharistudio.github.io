This Power BI report is a support ticket dashboard that shows how global teams help customers on behalf of colleagues from different offices and time zones a.k.a. follow-the-sun (FTS) support, including individual staff metrics to compare performance, and highlights outliers that may need to be addressed by managers or leads, depending on contractual SLAs.

The dataset used is completely randomised and fictional, including the names of people representing agents and users. This report also doesn't use any calendar tables or APIs, and instead uses Power Query functions and merges to apply offsets which respect daylight saving time changes dynamically based on the source date time value to be converted.

As this is a personal portfolio project, the pbix file won't be provided.

Alternatively, if you would like tutorial outlines on the approaches used to create this report, please see my blog posts:
